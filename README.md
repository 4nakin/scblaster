=========

This is a port of a Construct 2 game called Space Blaster.

As it stands, you should be able to run any Construct 2 game on a phone by simply:

- 1) exporting your Construct 2 game as an HTML5 app
- 2) cloning [this github repo](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/scblaster/)
- 3) replacing `src/c2runtime.js` with the `c2runtime.js` generated by Construct 2 for your game
- 4) replacing everything in `resources/images/` with the image assets from your game
- 5) replacing everything in `resources/media/` with the audio assets from your game
  - update the `AudioManager` in `Application.js` accordingly
- 6) running `fixAudio.py` and/or `fixImages.py` if necessary
  - if you have to run `fixImages.py`, replace the target prefix array on line 12 with whatever prefixes correspond to images with a black background that should actually be transparent

I know that's six whole steps. I want to simplify this process and probably turn this into some sort of plugin. I'll keep you guys posted.
